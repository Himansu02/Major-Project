        desc: `Rice, a staple crop globally, thrives under specific environmental conditions and soil compositions. When considering its growth, several factors come into play.

        In terms of soil nutrients, rice requires varying levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen is vital for leaf and stem growth, with recommended ranges typically falling between 80 to 120 kg/ha. Phosphorus aids in root development, with optimal ranges spanning from 20 to 40 kg/ha. Meanwhile, potassium, crucial for overall plant health, often ranges from 40 to 60 kg/ha.
        
        Soil pH levels are also critical, affecting nutrient availability to the rice plant. Ideally, pH levels should range from 5.5 to 7.0, ensuring optimal nutrient uptake.
        
        Regarding environmental conditions, rice cultivation is heavily influenced by rainfall, temperature, and humidity. Rice requires abundant water, with an average annual rainfall of 1000 to 2000 mm. However, during its growth stages, it may require flooding or standing water, especially during the initial vegetative stage.
        
        Temperature plays a significant role in rice cultivation, with optimal temperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C (68°F to 95°F). This temperature range is conducive to both vegetative and reproductive growth stages of the rice plant.
        
        Humidity levels also impact rice cultivation, with high humidity favoring growth. Relative humidity levels of 70% or higher are often beneficial, especially during flowering and grain filling stages, as they help prevent moisture stress.`
